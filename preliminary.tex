\paragraph{Existence of complementary subspaces}

\begin{corollary}\label{thm:compsubspaces}
	Let $V$ be a vector space and $W$ be a vector subspace of $V$. Then there exists a complementary vector subspace $W'$ in $V$ such that $W \cap W' = \emptyset$ and $W \cup W' = V$. This is equivalent to saying that $V$ is the direct sum of $W$ and $W'$, denoted as $V = W \oplus W'$.
