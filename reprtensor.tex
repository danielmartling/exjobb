\subsection{Tensor operations on representations}\label{sect:tensorrepr}

Building on the vector spaces constructed in Section~\ref{sect:tensoralgebra}, given two representations $V$ and $W$ of a group, the following are also representations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The \emph{direct sum of $V \oplus W$} is a representation given by 
	\begin{align*}
		\rho_{V \oplus W}(\vvec \oplus \wvec) = (\rho_V \oplus \rho_W)(\vvec \oplus \wvec) = \rho_V(\vvec) \oplus \rho_W(\wvec).
	\end{align*}
	
	\item By recursion, for a positive integer $n$, the \emph{direct sum of $n$ copies of $V$}, denoted
	\begin{align*}
		nV := \bigoplus_{i=1}^n V = \underset{\text{$n$ times}}{\underbrace{V \oplus \dots \oplus V}},
	\end{align*}
	is a representation.
	
	\item The \emph{tensor product $V \otimes W$} is a representation given by
	\begin{align*}
		\rho_{V \otimes W}(\vvec \otimes \wvec) = (\rho_V \otimes \rho_W)(\vvec \otimes \wvec) = \rho_V(\vvec) \otimes \rho_W(\wvec).
	\end{align*}
	
	\item By recursion, for a positive integer $n$, the \emph{$n$th tensor power of $V$}, denoted
	\begin{align*}
		V^{\otimes n} := \bigotimes_{i=1}^n V = \underset{\text{$n$ times}}{\underbrace{V \otimes \dots \otimes V}},
	\end{align*}
	is a representation. The zeroth power is by definition the ground field $\CC$ and the first power is $V$ itself.
	
	\item The $n$th tensor power has two subrepresentations, the symmetric powers $\SymP^n V$ and the exterior powers $\AltP^n V$. \textit{Needs further explanation, especially the squares.}
	
	\item After fixing a basis $(\bas_i)_{i=1}^k$ for $V$, a \emph{dual representation}, denoted $V^*$, can be defined by the dual space, spanned by the ...
	
	\item Set of homomorphisms...
\end{itemize}


\begin{example}[Decomposition of the permutation representation of $\Sym_3$]
	Letting $V$ be the permutation representation of $\Sym_3$, it was found to have two complementary subrepresentations $W$ and $W'$. \textit{TODO: IT WOULD BE NICE TO SHOW MATRICES FULFILL FOR EXAMPLE $\rho_{(1,2)}^V = \rho_{(1,2)}^W \oplus \rho_{(1,2)}^{W'}$ in some bases. LOW PRIO.}
\end{example}
