# Initial definitions

- Finite groups and finite-dim vector spaces
- Def. of representation
    - Linear map,
    - Linearity of map
    - Homomorphism
    - Id and inverse maps
- Representation space
- Note on abusive notation
- Choice of basis gives us matrix representations

# Tensor operations of representations
- Direct sum
- Tensor product

# Typical examples
- Trivial repr. of any groups
- Trivial repr. in any vector space
- Alternating repr. of S_n
- Degree one reprs. of C_n
- Permutation reprs.
    - Example: S_3, S_4, A_4
- Regular repr.
    - Example: C_3, show it is direct sum of deg 1 reprs.

# Subrepresentations and irreducibles
- G-linear map
- Def. subrepr.
    - Example: Trivial subspaces
- Proper subreprs.
    - Example: Trivial inside permutation and regular
    - Example: Alternating inside regular repr. of S_n
- Def. irreducible representation
    - Example: Degree one reprs.
- Subrepr. as kernel
    - Recall kernel and image of linear map
        - Example: Projection on subspace W < V is such that V = W + kernel (complementary)
    - Kernel and image of G-linear map of representations are subrepresentations
    - Complementary subrepresentations via projections on subreprs.
        - Short proof!
    - Corollary: Maschkes' theorem
        - Proof: Induction on subreprs., finite dimensional spaces, induction hypothesis.
    - Example: Standard representation is the complement to the trivial repr. in the permutation repr. of S_n
    - Example: Basis change to show Perm = Triv + Stan.

# Schur's lemma
- Statement of theorem
- Comprehensive proof
- Decomposition and multiplicities
- Corollary on abelian groups?

# Characters
- Recall trace of matrix
    - Properties (sum of eigenvalues, invariant under conjugation, independent of basis)
- Def. Characters
    - Properties (degree, inverse, class function)
- Def. Group character (vector)
- Def. Character table

- Character calculus
    - Def. Addition multiplication of characters
    - Characters of direct sums and tensor products
    - Example: S_3 and S_4 so far + calculations

- Orthogonality relations of characters
    - Derivation of dim Hom V W G
    - As a corollary of Schur's lemma, dim hom V W G is 1 or 0
    - Def. inner product of characters
    - Theorem: Irreducibility criterion - irreducible iff inner product = 1
        - Example: S_3 and S_4

- Decomposition of Regular repr
    - Regular character is (|G|, 0, ...)
    - Inner product of reg with itself
    - multiplicity of every irred in reg

- Examples
    - C_n
    - S_3
    - S_4
