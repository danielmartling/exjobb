\section{Groups}

This section on groups is mostly based on the treatment on groups of \cite{DummitFoote}.

\begin{definition}[Group]
	A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\star$ fulfilling:
	\begin{enumerate}[G1.]
		\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item Closure under the operation.%The set is closed under the operation, that is $gh$ is also an element.
		\item Associativity under the operation.%The operation is associative, that is $g(hi) = ghi = (gh)i$.
		\item Existence of a unique identity element.%There exists a unique \textbf{identity element} $e$ in $G$ that leaves every element fixed, that is $ge = g = eg$.
		\item Existence of unique inverses.%For every element $g$ there exists a unique \textbf{inverse element} $g^-1$ such that $gg^{-1} = e = g^{-1}g$.
		\textit{\item\label{axiom:G4} (If the group is commutative, it is called abelian.)}%(If every element of $G$ commutes, that is $gh = hg$, the group is said to be commutative, or \textbf{abelian}.)}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Sometimes the group is denoted by $(G,\star)$ but usually the operation is dropped and the set $G$ alone represents the group, especially if the operation is inferred from context. The last axiom G5 is not generally true for all groups. 

\begin{example}[Additive groups]
	The number sets $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$ and $\C$ are all abelian group under ordinary addition. %Their identity element is $0$ and for a number $n$, its inverse is $-n$. 
	A vector space $V$ over a field $\K$ is an abelian group under vector addition. %The identity element is the zero vector $\vec{0}$ and the inverse of a vector $v \in V$ is $-v$.
	For an integer $n>0$, the set of residue classes of modulo $n$, denoted $\Z/n\Z$, is an group under addition modulo $n$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Multiplicative groups]
	The sets $\Q$, $\R$ and $\C$ without $0$ (denoted $\Q^{\times}$, $\R^{\times}$ and $\C^{\times}$) are  groups under ordinary multiplication. %The identity element is $1$ and the inverse of the number $n$ is $1/n = n^{-1}$.
	The general linear group (for an integer $n>0$, the set of invertible\footnote{Non-zero determinant} $n \times n$-matrices with entries from the field $\K$), denoted $\GL_n(K)$ is a group under matrix multiplication. 
	The set $(\Z/n\Z)^{\times}$ is a group under multiplication modulo $n$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Subgroups}

	\begin{definition}[Subgroup]
		A non-empty subset $H \subseteq G$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if it is closed under inverses. Then it is denoted by $H \leq G$.
	\end{definition}

	Every group $G$ has these subgroups:
	
	\begin{example}
		The group $G$ is a subgroup of itself. However, a proper subgroup $H \neq G$ is denoted by $H < G$. The singleton $\{e\}$ is called the trivial subgroup.
	\end{example}
	
	The examples from the previous section has the following subgroups.
	
	\begin{example}
		The ordinary number sets are related by $\C \subset \R \subset \Q \subset \Z$. The integers has subgroups $n\Z$ for an integer $n>0$. The special linear group with entries from a field $\K$, denoted by $\SL_n(\K)$ is a subgroup of $\GL_n(\K)$.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}[Center]
		The center of a group $G$ is the set of elements of $G$ that commute and is denoted by $Z(G)$. Since $e$ is in $Z(G)$, it is a subgroup of $G$. If $G$ is abelian, $Z(G) = G$.	
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}[Centralizer and Normalizer]
		The centralizer of a subset $A \subseteq G$ is the set of elements that commutes with every element of $A$.
		The normalizer of a subset $A \subseteq G$ is the set of elements that leaves the set $A$ fixed  under conjugation. Clearly, both the centralizer and the normalizer are subgroups of $G$, and the centralizer is a subgroup of the normalizer.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{definition}[Normal subgroup]
		A subgroup $N \leq G$ is called normal if it is invariant under conjugation by $G$. It is denoted by $N \trianglelefteq G$. A proper normal subgroup is denoted by $N \triangleleft G$. 
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{example}
		Any group is a normal subgroup to itself. In an abelian group, every subgroup is normal. In $GL_n(\K)$, $\SL_n(\K)$ is normal.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{definition}[Simple group]
		A group is called simple if there are no non-trivial and proper normal subgroups.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{example}
		The integers modulo $n$ is a simple group if $n$ is a prime. For example, $\Z/7\Z$ has only itself and $\{e\}$ as normal subgroups, and as a non-example the integers have the even integers as a non-trivial and proper normal subgroup.
	\end{example}
	
\subsection{The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$}
	
	The set of all permutations of the numbers $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$ is called the symmetric group of degree $n$ and is denoted by\footnote{The strange symbol is a ``fraktur'' $S$.} $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Equivalently, it is the set of bijections from $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$ to itself. The order of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ is $n!$. 
	
	\begin{example}
		The elements of $\mathfrak{S}_3$ are 
		\[
		e,(12),(13),(23),(123),(132).
		\]
		There are $3!=6$ elements: the identity element, three transpositions\footnote{2-cycles are called transpositions.} and two 3-cycles.
	\end{example}
	
	
\subsection{The alternating group $\mathfrak{A}_n$}
	
	The subset of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ consisting of even\footnote{A permutation is considered even if it can be decomposed to an even number of 2-cycles, or equivalently it is of odd length.} permutations is called the alternating group of degree $n$ and is denoted by $\mathfrak{A}_n$. The order of $\mathfrak{A}_n$ is $n!/2$. The alternating group is a normal subgroup of the symmetric group of same degree.
	
	\begin{example}
		The elements of $\mathfrak{A}_3$ are 
		\[
		e,(123),(132).
		\]
		There are $3!/2=3$ elements: the identity element, and two 3-cycles. It is isomorphic to $\Z/3\Z$.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}
		The alternating group of degree 4, $\mathfrak{A}_4$ has a normal subgroup
		\[
		V =\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}
		\]
		This group is called the Klein-four group and it is isomorphic to $\Z_2^2$.
	\end{example}
	
\subsection{Dihedral groups $\D_{2n}$}
	
	The set of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon centered on the origin in the plane is called the dihedral group of order $2n$ and is denoted by $\D_{2n}$. It can be constructed via two generators $r$ and $s$ where $r$ is the rotation of the $n$-gon by $2\pi/n$ around the origin and $s$ is the reflection along the axis between the origin and an arbitrary ``first'' vertex, and the relations between them. Clearly, the order of $r$ is $n$ and $s$ is 2, so
	\[
	D_{2n} = \left\langle r,s \ \middle\vert \ r^n = s^2 = e, sr = rs^{-1} \right\rangle.
	\] 
	
	\begin{example}
		The symmetries of the triangel is
		\[
		D_6 = \{ e, (123), (132), (12), (23), (13) \},
		\]
		hence it is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{S}_3$.
	\end{example}
	
\subsection{Quotient groups}

	The normal subgroups subgroups discussed above are important, because they permit the existence of quotient groups.
	
	\begin{example}
		The integers $\Z$ has a normal\footnote{Any subgroup of $\Z$ is normal since $\Z$ is abelian.} subgroup $n\Z$. The quotient group $\Z/n\Z$ are the integers modulo $n$.
	\end{example}

\section{Some introductory background topics}
	
	\subsection{Group theory}
	
	
	
		This section on groups is mostly based on the treatment of \cite{DummitFoote}.
		
		\subsubsection{Introduction to Groups}
		
		\begin{definition}[Group]
			A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation\footnote{Examples of binary operators are ordinary addition or multiplication, addition $\mod n$ for some integer $n$, vector addition, composition of functions and matrix addition and multiplication.} $\star: G \times G \rightarrow G$ fulfilling:
			\begin{enumerate}[i)]
				\item Associativity over the binary operation. For any $a,b,c \in G$, $a \star (b \star c) = (a \star b) \star c = a \star b \star c$.
				\item Existence of a unique identity element in $G$. There is an element $e \in G$ such that for any $a \in G$, $a \star e = a = e \star a$.
				\item Existence of unique inverses for every element of $G$. For every $a \in G$, there is an element denoted $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \star a^{-1} = e = a^{-1} \star a$.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{definition}
		
		Usually the $\star$ symbol is dropped when it is clear from context what operation we are using. In an additive group, the operation is addition. Usually something that looks like zero\footnote{For example 0, the zero vector, the zero matrix...} is the additive identity element and an inverse of an element $a$ is usually denoted by $-a$.
			
		\begin{example}[Some additive groups]
			Some examples of additive groups are $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$ and $\C$; any vector space under vector addition and the integers mod $n$, denoted $\Z / n \Z$.
		\end{example}
		
		In a multiplicative group, the operation is usually some sort of multiplication or composition. Usually something that looks like one\footnote{For example 1, the unit matrix $\1_n = (\delta_{ij})_{n \times n}$, the identity permutation $\id = e$...} is the multiplicative identity element.
		
		\begin{example}[Some multiplicative groups]	
			Some examples of multiplicative groups are $\Z^\times$, $\Q^\times$, $\R^\times$ and $\C^\times$ (these are the subsets of their additive counterpart where zero has been removed since it lacks a multiplicative inverse.); $(\Z / n \Z)^\times$; The set of all invertible square $n \times n$ matrices denoted by $\GL(\C)$; Difference between GL(V) and GL(C)?
		\end{example}
		
		In general, any two elements of a group do not commute, that is for $a,b \in G$, $ab \neq ba$. However the special case when every element is commutative is important.
		
		\begin{definition}[Abelian group]
			A group $G$ in which every element commutes with every other element (that is $ab = ba$ for every $a,b \in G$) is called a commutative group, or an Abelian group.
		\end{definition}
		
		\subsubsection{Subgroups}
		
		\begin{definition}[Subgroup]
			A non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if it fulfills:
			\begin{enumerate}[i)]
				\item Closure under the operation of $G$. If $h_1, h_2 \in H$, then $h_1 h_2, h_2 h_1 \in H$.
				\item Closure under inverses. If $h \in H$, then there is an element $h^{-1} \in H$.
			\end{enumerate}
			If $H$ is a subgroup $G$, we denote the relation by $H \leq G$. The trivial subgroup is the subset of $G$ only consisting of the identity element of $G$, that is $\{e\}$. A proper subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a proper subset of $G$ and is denoted by $H < G$.
		\end{definition}
		
		\begin{definition}[Centralizer]
			The centralizer of an element $a$ of $G$ is the set of elements of $G$ that commutes with $a$, and is denoted by 
			\[
				\Cent_G(a) = \{ g \in G \mid ga = ag \}.
			\]
			It is non-empty since it contains the identity element.
		\end{definition}
		
		\begin{definition}[Stabilizer]
			The stabilizer of an element $a$ of $G$ is the set of elements of $G$ that fixes $a$, and is denoted by 
			\[
				\Stab_G(a) = \{ g \in G \mid g \star a = a \}.
			\]
			It is non-empty since it contains the identity element.
		\end{definition}
		
		\subsubsection{Some special and interesting groups}
		
		\begin{definition}[The dihedral group of order $2n$]
			For every integer $n \geq 3$, the set of all symmetries of a regular planar $n$-gon centered on the origin is called the dihedral group of order $2n$ and is denoted by $\D_{2n}$. The vertices of the regular $n$-gon are labeled clockwise from 1 to $n$. The dihedral group is generated by the two kinds of operations permitted on this rigid $n$-gon: rotation and reflexion. We define relection $s$ about the symmetry line through vertex 1 and the origin. Rotation $r$ is defined by either moving every vertex $i$ to the vertex $i+1 \mod n$, or one step clock-wise or equivalently by rotating the $n$-gon $2 \pi /n$ radians. We see that the order\footnote{The order of an element $g \in G$ is the smallest possible positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = e$.} of $s$ is 2 and of $r$ is $n$.
			
			The dihedral group can be constructed using $s$ and $r$ as generators along with some information on how $s$ and $r$ relate:
			$$ \D_{2n} = \left\langle r, s \mid r^n = s^2 = 1, rs = sr^{-1} \right\rangle.$$
		\end{definition}
		
		\begin{definition}[The symmetric group of degree $n$]
			The set of bijections from the set $\{1, 2, \dots n\}$ to itself if denoted $S_n$ and is called the symmetric group of degree $n$. Clearly $S_n$ has order $n!$. The associated operation is cycle decomposition $\circ$. For two permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, their decomposition is $\sigma \circ \tau = \sigma \tau$.
		\end{definition}
		
		The elements of $S_n$ can be represented in some different ways, one is to decompose every permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ to a product of pairwise disjoint\footnote{Two cycles are disjoint if they have no numbers in common.} cycles. The congruence class an element of $S_n$ is determined by the shape of its cycle decomposition, for example if an element consist of a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle, it is in the same conjugacy class of every other such cycle. A representative of a congruence can be chosen arbitrarily, and is surrounded by square brackets, for example is $\left[ e \right]$ is the conjugacy class consisting of only $e$.
		
		
		\begin{example}[$S_3$ and $S_4$]
			The elements of $S_3$ and $S_4$ are presented in the following tables.
			
%			\begin{center}
%				\begin{tabular}{r c l }
%					                   & $S_3$ &                      \\
%					  $\left[e\right]$ & $=$   & $\{e\}$              \\
%					 $\left[12\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(12),(13),(23)\}$ \\
%					$\left[123\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(123),(132)\}$
%				\end{tabular}
%				\\
%				\begin{tabular}{r c l }
%					                        & $S_4$ &                                                       \\
%					       $\left[e\right]$ & $=$   & $\{e\}$                                               \\
%					      $\left[12\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(12),(13),(14),(23),(24),(34)\}$                   \\
%					     $\left[123\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(123),(124),(132),(134),(142),(143),(234),(243)\}$ \\
%					    $\left[1234\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(1234),(1243),(1324),(1342),(1423),(1432)\}$       \\
%					$\left[(12)(34)\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}$
%				\end{tabular}
%			\end{center}
		\end{example}
		
		A subgroup of $S_n$ is the subset of even\footnote{A permutation is called even(odd) if its order is even(odd) permutations.} permutations. This is called the alternating group. For the examples above,
		
		\begin{example}[$A_3$ and $A_4$]
			The elements of $S_3$ and $S_4$ are presented in the following tables.
			
%			\begin{center}
%				\begin{tabular}{r c l }
%					                   & $A_3$ &                   \\
%					  $\left[e\right]$ & $=$   & $\{e\}$           \\
%					$\left[123\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(123),(132)\}$
%				\end{tabular}
%				\\
%				\begin{tabular}{r c l }
%					                        & $A_4$ &                                                       \\
%					       $\left[e\right]$ & $=$   & $\{e\}$                                               \\
%					     $\left[123\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(123),(124),(132),(134),(142),(143),(234),(243)\}$ \\
%					$\left[(12)(34)\right]$ & $=$   & $\{(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}$
%				\end{tabular}
%			\end{center}			
		\end{example}
