\subsection{Vector spaces over a field}

	In part based on \cite{Jeevanjee}.

	\begin{definition}[Vector space over a field, dimension, basis]
		A vector space over a field is an abelian group of vectors $V$ together with a field of scalars $\K$, equipped with vector addition and scalar multiplication. 
		A subset of $V$ that is component-wise linearly independent and spans the vector space is called a basis and is denoted by $\left\lbrace\mathbf{e}_i\right\rbrace_{i=1}^n = \left\lbrace \mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \dots, \mathbf{e}_n \right\rbrace$. There may be multiple bases in a vector space. 
		The number of basis vectors needed to span the space is called the dimension of the space and is denoted by $n = \dim V$. 
		The natural choice of basis for $\R^n$ is the orthonormal basis $\left\lbrace \delta_{ij} \right\rbrace_{i=1}^n$.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{example}
		For a positive integer $n$, $\K^n$ are vector spaces over any field $\F$. The group of invertible $n \times n$-matrices $\GL_n(\K)$ is not a vector space since $\mathbf{0}$ is not in $\GL_n(\K)$, however the set of all $n \times n$-matrices $\mathcal{M}_n(\K)$ is a vector space (it is an additive group).
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{remark}[Modules]
		If $V$ is a vector space over a field $\K$, then $V$ is the same as a $\K$-module.
	\end{remark}
	
	\begin{definition}[Dual space]
		For any vector space $V$ over the field $\K$ there is a corresponding dual vector space denoted $V^*$. If the elements of $V$ are $\{\mathbf{v}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and a basis is $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, then the dual space $V^*$ has elements $\{\mathbf{v}^i\}_{i=1}^n$ and a basis is $\{\mathbf{e}^i\}_{i=1}^n$. An element $v^i$ of $V^*$ can also be interpreted as a $(1,0)$-tensor
		\[
			v^i: V \longrightarrow \K,
		\]
		in this sense, $V^*$ is the set of linear maps from $V$ to $\K$ denoted by $V^* = \Hom(V,\K)$.
		The spaces $V$ and $V^*$ carry a ``natural pairing'' that is a bilinear mapping
		\[
			\bra{\mathbf{v}^j}\ket{\mathbf{v}_i}: V \times V^* \longrightarrow \K
		\]
		that for basis vectors is defined as
		\[
			\bra{\mathbf{e}^j}\ket{\mathbf{e}_i} = {\delta_i}^j.
		\]
	\end{definition}
