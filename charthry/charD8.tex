\subsection{Character table of the dihedral group of order 8, $\D_8$}

$\D_8$ is a 2-Sylow subgroup of $S_4$. Restrict the character table of $S_4$ to $\D_8$. 

$\D_8$ has its non-trivial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              center $Z(\D_8) = \{e, r^2\}$ as a normal subgroup. The quotient $\D_8/\{e, r^2\}$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. The character table of the Klein 4-group is a ``subset'' of the character table of $\D_8$.
