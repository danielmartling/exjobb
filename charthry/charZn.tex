\subsection{Character tables of $Z_n$}

In section \ref{sect:reprZn}, the $n$ degree 1 representations of any cyclic group $Z_n$ was described, and by theorem \ref{thm:numberirrep}, those described are all irreducible representations of $Z_n$. Therefore the tables \ref{table:Z3}, \ref{table:Z4} and \ref{table:Z5} are the character tables of respectively $Z_3$, $Z_4$ and $Z_5$.

%In every character table, the first row corresponds to the trivial representation found in section \ref{sect:trivrepr} and for an even $n$, the character table also contains a ``alternating representation'' since these cyclic groups are isomorphic to the rotation subgroup of $\D_{2n}$.
