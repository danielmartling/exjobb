\subsection{Subrepresentations}\label{sect:subrepr}

As laid out in~\cite[Sect.1.2.]{FultonHarris}, we are looking for representations which are said to be ``atomic'' or ``indivisible'' and conversely, for any arbitrary representation we wish to find how it is composed of these indecomposable representations. To proceed we need the notion of a vector space map that respects or conserves the group action.	

\begin{definition}[$G$-linear map]\cite{FultonHarris}
	Let $V$ and $W$ be two representation spaces of a group $G$. A vector space map 
		$\varphi: V \rightarrow W$
	is called a $G$-linear map if it commutes with, or respects, the group action of $G$, ie. for any $\vvec \in V$ and $g \in G$ we have
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi( g \cdot \vvec ) = g \cdot \varphi (\vvec),
	\end{align*}
	or in terms of the maps $\rho_g^V: G \rightarrow \GL(V)$ and $\rho_g^W: G \rightarrow \GL(W)$,
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi \circ \rho^V_g (\vvec) = \rho^W_g \circ \varphi (\vvec).
	\end{align*}
	Equivalently one can say that the diagram in Figure~\ref*{fig:commapmorp} commutes for every $g \in G$.

\end{definition}

Consider the case where $W$ is a subspace of $V$ left fixed by $G$, that is $gW \subseteq W$ for all $g \in G$. Such a subspace is called $G$-invariant. Let $\rho^V$ be a representation of $G$, then the restriction of $\rho^V$ to $W$, here denoted $\rho^V|_W$, is a isomorphism (and then also a homomorphism) of $W$ onto itself since $W$ is $G$-invariant, hence $\rho^V|_W: G \rightarrow \GL(W)$ is a representation of $G$ in the subspace $W$ of $V$, motivating the following definition:

\begin{definition}[Subrepresentation]\label{def:subrepr}
	Let $G$ be a finite group and $\rho$ be a representation of $G$ in a vector space $V$. A restriction of $\rho$ to a $G$-invariant vector subspace $W$ of $V$ is called a subrepresentation of $\rho$.
\end{definition}

%In other words, a subrepresentation is a $G$-invariant vector subspace of a ``parent'' representation. 

\begin{example}[Trivial subspaces]
	Any representation has itself as well as the zero space as subrepresentations. These are referred to as non-proper or trivial subrepresentations and usually omitted.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Finally some proper subrepresentations}

Let $G$ be any group and let us study its permutation and regular representations. 

\begin{example}[Trivial representation inside the permutation representation]\cite[Example 1.4.3.]{Sagan}\label{example:trivpermrepr}
	Let $G$ act on a set $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k\}$, where $k = |X|$, and let $V$ be the vector space spanned by the basis $(\xhat_1, \xhat_2, \dots, \xhat_k)$. Consider the one-dimensional subspace of $V$ spanned by the sum of all basis vectors, ie. 
	\begin{align*}	
		W = \Span\{ \xhat_1 + \xhat_2 + \dots + \xhat_k \}.
	\end{align*}A vector $\wvec \in W$ is a scalar multiple of this sum, and for any $g \in G$, the action of $g$ on $\wvec$ will simply reorder this sum and return the same $\wvec$, that is for any $g \in G$, we have that $\rho_g|_W = 1$. Thus $W$ is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ and the permutation representation has the trivial representation as a subrepresentation.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Trivial representation inside the regular representation]\cite[Example 1.4.4.]{Sagan}
	Similarly to the last example, we span a vector space $V$ by a basis $(\ghat_1, \ghat_2, \dots, \ghat_{k})$ for every $g_i \in G$, where $k = |G|$, and consider the one-dimensional subspace 
	\begin{align*}
		W = \Span\{ \ghat_1 + \ghat_2 + \dots + \ghat_k \}. 
	\end{align*}
	Completely analogous to the last example, $W$ is shown to be a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ and the regular representation also has the trivial representation as a subrepresentation.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Alternating representation inside the regular representation of $\Sym_n$]\cite[Example 1.4.4.]{Sagan}
	Let $G = \Sym_n$, then for the regular representation, $V$ is spanned by a basis vector for every $\sigma \in \Sym_n$. Let $W$ be the subspace of $V$ spanned by the sum $\sum_{\sigma \in \Sym_n} \sgn(\sigma) \bas_{\sigma}$. The action of a $\tau \in \Sym_n$ on a $\wvec \in W$ is
	\begin{align*}
		\tau (\wvec) &= \tau \cdot a\sum_{\sigma \in \Sym_n} \sgn(\sigma) \bas_{\sigma} \\
		&= a \sum_{\sigma \in \Sym_n} \sgn(\sigma) \bas_{\tau\sigma} \\
		&= a \frac{1}{\sgn\tau} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sym_n} \sgn(\tau\sigma) \bas_{\tau\sigma}  \\
		&= \{\text{Scalar factor}\} \cdot \wvec,
	\end{align*}
	where $a \in \CC$, hence $W$ is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ and the alternating representation is also found inside the regular representation of the symmetric group.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Subrepresentations as a kernel}

From linear algebra, we are familiar with the kernel and image of a map (see Definition~\ref{def:kernelimage}).

\begin{proposition}[Kernel and image of a $G$-linear map]\label{prop:kernelimagelinearmap}
	Let $V$ and $W$ be representation spaces of a group $G$ and let $\varphi: V \rightarrow W$ be a $G$-linear map. Then the kernel and the image of $\varphi$ are also representations of $G$ and more specifically, $\ker \varphi$ is a subrepresentation of $V$ and $\im \varphi$ is a subrepresentation of $W$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[i)] Let $\vvec \in \ker \varphi$. Then $g \cdot \varphi (\vvec) = \0$ since by definition $\varphi(\vvec) = \0$, but then we must also have $\varphi ( g \cdot \vvec ) = \0$ since $\varphi$ is a $G$-linear map, implying that $g \cdot \vvec \in \ker \varphi$. Since this holds for any $g \in G$ and $\vvec \in \ker \varphi$, the kernel of $\varphi$ is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ and a subrepresentation of $V$. 
		\item[ii)] For a $\wvec \in \im \varphi$, by definition there exists a $\vvec \in V$ such that $\varphi(\vvec) = \wvec$. Since $g \cdot \vvec \in V$, then we have that $\varphi ( g \cdot \vvec) \in W$. This implies that $g \cdot \varphi (\vvec)$ is also in $W$. Since this holds for any $g \in G$ and $\vvec \in V$, the image of $\varphi$ is a $G$-invariant subspace of $W$ and a subrepresentation of $W$.	\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Recall from linear algebra the existence of complementary vector subspaces of a vector space (Theorem~\ref{thm:compsubspaces}).  Is there a similar property of subrepresentations? Consider the case when $W$ is a subrepresentation of $V$ and let $\pi: V \rightarrow W$ be the projection of $V$ onto $W$. Recall (Theorem~\ref{thm:compsubspaces})~that for each subspace $W$ of $V$ there exists a complementary and disjoint subspace $W'$ in $V$ such that $V = W \oplus W'$. This means that every $\vvec \in V$ is partitioned into $\wvec \oplus \wvec'$ where $\wvec \in W$ and $\wvec' \in W'$ such that 
\begin{align*}
	\begin{cases}
		\pi(\vvec) = \wvec, \\
		\pi(\wvec) = \wvec \text{ and } \\
		\pi(\wvec') = \0.
	\end{cases}
\end{align*} 
The image of the projection is clearly $W$ and the kernel is $W'$. But is $\pi$ a $G$-linear map?
{\allowdisplaybreaks\begin{proposition}[Existence of complementary subrepresentations]\label{prop:complsubrepr}
	Let $\rho$ be a representation of a finite group $G$ in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Let $W$ be a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$. Then there exists a $G$-invariant subspace $W'$ of $V$ complementary to $W$ such that $V = W \oplus W'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	By Proposition~\ref{prop:kernelimagelinearmap} we know that a $G$-linear map from one representation space $V$ to another $W$ has its kernel as a subrepresentation of $V$. If we can find such a $G$-linear map from $V$ to a $G$-invariant subspace $W$ we are done.
	The projection $\pi$ may not generally be a $G$-linear map, instead we consider taking the \textit{average} of $\pi$ over $G$,
	\begin{align*}
		\barpi := \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \rho_g \cdot \pi \cdot \rho_g^{-1},
	\end{align*}
	and see if it conserves the action of $G$. Note that $\barpi$ is still a projection of $V$ onto $W$ since $g$ preserves $W$. Now, does $\barpi\cdot \rho_g = \rho_g \cdot \barpi$ hold for every $g \in G$? Equivalently, let's consider
	\begin{align*}
		\rho_g \cdot \barpi \cdot \rho_g^{-1} &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{h \in G} \rho_g \cdot \rho_h \cdot \pi \cdot \rho_h^{-1} \cdot \rho_g^{-1} & \text{(Def. of $\barpi$)}\\
		&= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{h \in G} \rho_{gh} \cdot \pi \cdot \rho_{gh}^{-1} & \text{($\rho$ homom., $(gh)^{-1}=h^{-1}g^{-1}$)}\\
		&= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g' \in G} \rho_{g'} \cdot \pi \cdot \rho_{g'}^{-1} & \text{(Let $g' = gh$)} \\
		&= \barpi. & \text{(Def. of $\barpi$)}
	\end{align*}
	So, $\barpi \cdot \rho_g = \rho_g \cdot \barpi$ for every $g \in G$ and thus $\barpi: V \rightarrow W$ is a $G$-linear map, which means that its kernel is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ complementary to $W$ such that $V = W \oplus \ker \barpi$.%, and thereby a subrepresentation of $V$.
\end{proof}}

{\allowdisplaybreaks\subsubsection{The standard represention of $\Sym_n$}
In Example~\ref{example:trivpermrepr}, the trivial representation was found to be a subrepresentation of the permutation representation. Let $G= \Sym_n$ and let $V$ be the permutation representation and assign it the basis $(\bas_i)_{i=1}^n$. The one-dimensional subspace $W$ spanned by the sum of all $\bas_i$ was found to be the trivial representation, then by Proposition~\ref{prop:complsubrepr}, there exists another subrepresentation $W'$ of $V$ complementary to $W$. The dimension of $W'$ is $n-1$. Let's introduce to $V$ an inner product $(\cdot|\cdot)$ that fulfills the expected properties, in particular:
\begin{align*}
	(\bas_i|\bas_j) = \delta_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{, if $i=j$,}\\
		0 \text{, if $i \neq j$.}
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
for the basis $(\bas_i)_{i=1}^n$. Then the basis $(\fbas_j)_{j=1}^{n-1}$ of $W'$ can be constructed by ensuring that each $\fbas_j$ is orthogonal to the basis vector of $W$, that is
\begin{align*}
	\left( \fbas_j \ \middle\vert \ \sum_{i=1}^n \bas_i \right) = 0
\end{align*}
for every $1 \leq j \leq n-1$. One can see that one such basis is found by for example choosing every basis vector $\fbas_j$ to be the difference of two sequent $\bas_i$, that is choosing the basis $(\bas_j - \bas_{j+1})_{j=1}^{n-1}$ for $W'$. This is called the \emph{Standard representation of $\Sym_n$.}~\cite[??]{Serre, Sagan, FultonHarris}}

\begin{example}[Standard representation of $\Sym_3$]\label{example:stdSym3}
	The matrices of the standard representation is found by studying the action inherited from $\Sym_3$ on the basis 
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{cases}
			\fbas_1 = \bas_1-\bas_2, \\
			\fbas_2 = \bas_2-\bas_3.
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	For example, \begin{align*}
		(1,2)\cdot \fbas_1 &= (1,2)\cdot (\bas_1-\bas_2) = \bas_2-\bas_1 = -\fbas_1, \text{ and} \\
		(1,2)\cdot \fbas_2 &= (1,2) \cdot (\bas_2-\bas_3) = \bas_1-\bas_3 = \fbas_1 + \fbas_2,
	\end{align*} hence $\rho^\Stan_{(1,2)} = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}
		-1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1
	\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. The matrices are presented in Table~\ref{table:standardS3}.
	
	\begin{table}[hbt!]

			\end{pmatrix}$.

	\end{table}
\end{example}

If the trivial representation corresponds to the one-dimensional sum of all basis vectors of the permutation representation of $\Sym_n$ (in $\Sym_3$ this would be the diagonal through the origin and the point $(1,1,1)$) then the standard representation corresponds to the $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane perpendicular to that diagonal line. Again for $\Sym_3$, this is the plane intersecting the origin perpendicular to the line through the origin and the point $(1,1,1)$.

\begin{example}[Decomposition of the permutation representation of $\Sym_3$]
		Letting $V$ be a permutation representation space of $\Sym_3$, it was found to have two complementary subrepresentations $W$ and $W'$, denoted the trivial and the standard representations respectively. In the $\bas_1, \bas_2, \bas_3$-basis, the matrix for $(1,2)$ is by Example~\ref{ex:permS3}
		\begin{align*}
			\rho^\Perm_{(1,2)} = \begin{pmatrix}
				0&1&0 \\ 1&0&0 \\ 0&0&1
			\end{pmatrix}.
		\end{align*}
		Let's consider a basis change 
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				\fbas_1 = \bas_1 + \bas_2 + \bas_3 \\
				\fbas_2 = \bas_1 - \bas_2 \\
				\fbas_3 = \bas_2 - \bas_3
			\end{cases}
		\end{align*}
		with corresponding change-of-basis matrix
		\begin{align*}
			P = \begin{pmatrix}
				1&1&0 \\ 1&-1&0 \\ 1&0&-1
			\end{pmatrix}
		\end{align*}
		in accordance with the bases of the trivial and standard representations. Then the matrix for $(1,2)$ in this new basis is
		\begin{align*}
			P^{-1} \cdot \rho^\Perm_{(1,2)} \cdot P &= 
			\frac{1}{3}\begin{pmatrix}
				1&1&1\\2&-1&-1\\1&1&-2
			\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
				0&1&0 \\ 1&0&0 \\ 0&0&1
			\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
				1&1&0 \\ 1&-1&0 \\ 1&0&-1
			\end{pmatrix} \\
			&= \begin{pmatrix}
				1&0&0 \\ 0&-1&1 \\ 0&0&1
			\end{pmatrix}\\
			%		 &= (1)  \oplus \begin{pmatrix}
				%		 	-1&1 \\ 0&1
				%		 \end{pmatrix} \\
			&= \rho_{(1,2)}^\Triv \oplus \rho_{(1,2)}^\Stan.
		\end{align*}
		The same calculations on the other elements of $\Sym_3$ confirm that the permutation representation of $\Sym_3$ decomposes to the direct sum of the trivial and standard representations.
\end{example}
