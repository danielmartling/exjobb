## Definition

### Definition of represetntaion

* G a group written mult. and be of order |G|.
* V a vector space over the field C. Aut V = GL V. dim V = n. 
    * Basis (e_i)_{i=1}^n. GL V identified with GL_n C
    * (Sagan denotes GL_n)
* *A representation is...*
* Def. Representation
* Prop. id and inv repr
* Note. Matrix representation. Not canonical. rho and tilde rho are similar reprs. if there exists f in GL V such that tilde rho = f \circ rho
* Note. The representation rho and the vector space V are used interchangeably

### Subrepresentations and irreducibility
* Def. degree
* Def. subrepr.
* Def. irred. repr.
* Cor. Deg 1 repr are irred.

* Def. Complementary vector subspace
* Def. G-invariant vector subspace
* Prop. Existence of complement to G-invariant subspace

* Thm. Maschke's
* Proof. Induction/recursion on subrepr.

### Tensor operations on representations
As opposed to the previous section, where representations where reduced to their atomic constituents, one could likewise combine representations to obtain new representations.

* Direct sum U+V. Denote direct n-sum V+...+V by nV.
* Tensor product UxV
* Tensor powers Vxn
    * Subreprs. AltnV and SymnV
* Hom(U,V) = U* x V
    * Dual space V* = Hom(V,C)
