\subsection{Morphismsm of representations}

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\rho_V$ and $\rho_W$ be two representations of $G$ in the vector spaces $V$ and respectively $W$ such that $\rho_V: G \rightarrow \GL(V)$ and $\rho_W: G \rightarrow \GL(W)$, then a map $\varphi$ from the two representations is a map $\varphi:V \rightarrow W$.

If the map $\varphi$ is such that the diagram

	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		V \arrow{r}{\varphi} \arrow[swap]{d}{\rho_V(g)} & W \arrow{d}{\rho_W(g)} \\
		V \arrow{r}{\varphi} & W
	\end{tikzcd}\]

is commutative for every $g \in G$, it is called a $G$-linear map, or a \emph{morphism of representations}\cite{FultonHarris}. Since this holds for any $\vvec \in V$, we have that
\begin{align}\label{eq:Glinmap}
	\rho_g \circ \varphi = \varphi \circ \rho_g
\end{align}
for any $g \in G$.

The kernel of the map, $\ker \varphi$, defined as $\{\vvec \in V \ | \ \varphi(\vvec) = \0\}$, is a subrepresentation of $V$ since it is a subspace of $V$ \cite{Holst} and $G$-invariant, since clearly for a $\vvec \in \ker \varphi$, $\rho_g \circ \varphi(\vvec) = 0$, then also $\rho_g \circ \varphi(\vvec) = \0$, implying $\rho_g \circ \varphi(\vvec) \in \ker \varphi$.

The image of the map, $\Im \phi$, defined as $$\{ \phi(\vvec) \ | \ \vvec \in V \} = \{ \wvec \in W \ | \ \exists \vvec \in V \text{ s.t. } \varphi(\vvec) = \wvec \},$$ is similarly a subspace of $W$. Let $\wvec \in \Im \varphi$. Thne there exists a $\vvec \in V$ such that $\varphi(\vvec)=\wvec$, then $\rho_g \circ \varphi (\vvec) = \rho_g(\wvec)$, but by Equation \ref{eq:Glinmap}, then also $\varphi \circ \rho_g(\vvec) = \rho_g (\wvec)$, implying $\rho_g(\vvec) \in \Im \varphi$. The image is also $G$-invariant, and thus is a subrepresentation of $W$.

\subsubsection{Subrepresentations as a morphism of representations}

Let $V$ be a representation of a group $G$, and let $W$ be a $G$-invariant subspace, then the projection $\rho: V \rightarrow W$
