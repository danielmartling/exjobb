\section{Representation Theory of Finite Groups}

The layout of this section is based on \cite{FultonHarris} and \cite{Serre}.

Let $G$ be a finite group written multiplicatively. We denote its size by $|G|$ and the action of its elements with $\cdot$, for example by $g \cdot x$, sometimes shorted to $gx$.

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of complex numbers $\CC$. The group of invertible linear transformations of $V$ is denoted by $\GL(V)$. If $V$ is provided with a basis, usually denoted $(\bas_i)_{i=1}^n$ where $n = \dim V$, then $\GL(V)$ is identified with the set of invertible $n \times n$ matrices, denoted $\GL_n(\CC)$\cite[18.1]{DummitFoote}.

\begin{definition}[Representation]\cite{Serre}
	A representation of a group $G$ in the vector space $V$ is a homomorphism
	\begin{align}\label{eq:DefRepr}
		\rho: G \rightarrow \GL(V).
	\end{align}
	The dimension of $V$, denoted $\dim V$, is referred to as the \textit{degree} of the representation.
\end{definition}
For every $g$ in $G$, there is a linear map $\rho_g$ in $\GL(V)$ that performs the group action on $V$, ie. 
\begin{align*}
	g \cdot \vvec = \rho_g (\vvec).
\end{align*}
The linearity of the map means that for any $\vvec, \wvec \in V$,
\begin{align*}%\label{eq:linearityOfg}
	g \cdot (a\vvec + b\wvec) = ag\cdot\vvec + bg\cdot\wvec,
\end{align*} 
with $a,b \in \CC$ and also since it is a homomorphism, for any $g,h \in G$, we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:homomorphism}
	\rho_{gh} = \rho_g \rho_h.
\end{align}
From the homomorphism of $\rho$, two consequences follow.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:homoidinv}
	The homomorphism preserves identity and inverses. For the identity element $e$ of $G$ and an arbitrary element $g$ with inverse $g^{-1}$ in $G$ we have,
	\begin{align}\label{eq:rhoIdAndInv}
		\rho_e = \id \quad \text{and} \quad \rho_g^{-1} = \rho_{g^{-1}},
	\end{align}
	where $\id$ is the identity transformation and $\rho_{g^{-1}}$ is the map associated with the inverse of $g$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Take $g$ as an arbitrary element of $G$. The first identity follows from taking $h=e$ in Equation~\ref{eq:homomorphism}:
	\begin{align*}
		\rho_{eg} = \rho_e \rho_g.
	\end{align*}
	Since $eg=g$ for any $g\in G$ we must have that $\rho_g = \rho_e\rho_g$ which is true if and only if $\rho_e = \id$. Now instead taking $h=g^{-1}$ we have:
	\begin{align*}
		\rho_{gg^{-1}} = \rho_g \rho_{g^{-1}},
	\end{align*}
	but $gg^{-1} = e$ and $\rho_e = \id$, implying $\rho_{g^{-1}} = \rho_g^{-1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
	A vector space $V$ provided with such a homomorphism discussed above is said to be a \textit{representation space} of $G$%\footnote{In fact, this gives $V$ the structure of a $G$-module \cite[1.3]{Sagan}.}.
\end{notation}

\begin{note}
	The homomorphism $\rho$, the set of maps $\{\rho_g\}_{g \in G}$ and the representation space $V$ are interchangeably and abusively called the \textit{representation of $G$}.
\end{note}

%\paragraph{Choice of basis.} 

If a basis $(\bas_i)_{i=1}^n$ is provided for a representation space, then a \textit{matrix representation} can be provided. In this case, $\rho_g$ is the matrix in $\GL_n(\CC)$ associated with the action of $g$ expressed in the basis provided. A matrix representation is not canonical and is dependent on the basis chosen.
